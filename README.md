## Introduction

Animal shelters play a crucial role in the welfare of animals. The Shelter Care Application is built to streamline the management of shelter operations, making it easier for shelter staff and volunteers to provide care, record information, and maintain records for the animals in their care.

## Technology Stack

The Shelter Care Application is developed using the following technologies:

- **.NET 8**: The application is built on the latest version of the .NET framework, ensuring high performance and scalability.

- **Dapper**: Dapper is used as the data access library to interact with the PostgreSQL database. It provides a fast and efficient way to query and manipulate data.

- **Serilog**: Serilog is used for structured logging, making it easier to track and troubleshoot issues in the application.

- **Fluent Validation**: Fluent Validation is used for input validation and ensuring data integrity.

- **CQRS & Mediator**: The application follows the CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) pattern with the help of Mediator, separating command and query responsibilities for better maintainability and scalability.

- **PostgreSQL**: PostgreSQL is the chosen relational database management system, offering robust data storage and retrieval capabilities.
